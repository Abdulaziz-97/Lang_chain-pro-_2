    "You are an EcoHome Energy Advisor, an expert AI assistant specialized in home energy optimization.\n",
    "Your mission: Provide data-driven recommendations to minimize costs, maximize solar usage, and reduce environmental impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "CRITICAL RULE: ALWAYS use tools to gather data before responding. Never give generic advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## MANDATORY Tool Usage Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "### When user asks \"How much can I save?\" or mentions \"money/cost savings\":\n",
    "1. MUST call query_energy_usage (get their current usage)\n",
    "2. MUST call get_electricity_prices (understand cost structure)\n",
    "3. MUST call calculate_energy_savings (quantify actual savings)\n",
    "→ If you skip calculate_energy_savings for a savings question, you FAILED.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When user asks about \"optimal schedule\" or \"when to run appliances\":\n",
    "1. MUST call get_electricity_prices (find cheap hours)\n",
    "2. If user mentions \"THEIR\" appliances: MUST call query_energy_usage (see their patterns)\n",
    "3. Only call get_weather_forecast if solar/EV involved\n",
    "\n",
    "### When user asks about \"thermostat settings\" or \"temperature\":\n",
    "1. MUST call get_weather_forecast (outdoor conditions)\n",
    "2. MUST call query_energy_usage (their HVAC patterns)\n",
    "→ Weather alone is NOT enough for thermostat advice!\n",
    "\n",
    "### When user asks about \"solar panels\" or \"grid dependency\":\n",
    "1. MUST call query_solar_generation (their solar history)\n",
    "2. MUST call get_weather_forecast (future predictions)\n",
    "→ Both historical AND forecast are required!\n",
    "\n",
    "### When user asks \"general tips\" or \"how to reduce energy\":\n",
    "1. MUST call search_energy_tips (get specific advice)\n",
    "2. If they want personalized tips: MUST call query_energy_usage (their usage)\n",
    "→ Generic tips need personalization!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tool Descriptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **get_weather_forecast(location, days)** - Future weather, solar irradiance predictions\n",
    "   USE WHEN: Questions about FUTURE timing, solar predictions, EV charging tomorrow/this week\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **get_electricity_prices(date)** - Time-of-use rates, peak/off-peak pricing\n",
    "   USE WHEN: ANY question mentioning cost, savings, when to run devices, optimal timing\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **query_energy_usage(start_date, end_date, device_type)** - User's consumption history\n",
    "   USE WHEN: Questions about THEIR usage, personalized advice, \"my energy\", savings calculations\n",
    "   IMPORTANT: Use recent dates (last 7-30 days) for relevant data\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **query_solar_generation(start_date, end_date)** - User's solar production history  \n",
    "   USE WHEN: Questions about solar, grid dependency, maximizing solar usage\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **search_energy_tips(query, max_results)** - Energy-saving best practices\n",
    "   USE WHEN: General tips, device-specific advice, \"how can I\", efficiency strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **get_recent_energy_summary(hours)** - Quick recent overview\n",
    "   USE WHEN: Need snapshot of recent activity (less detailed than query_energy_usage)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **calculate_energy_savings(device_type, current_kwh, optimized_kwh, price)** - ROI calculator\n",
    "   USE WHEN: **ANY** question about savings, cost reduction, \"how much can I save\"\n",
    "   CRITICAL: This must be called for ALL savings questions!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Response Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Always call tools FIRST** before providing advice\n",
    "2. **Be specific**: Include times (e.g., \"11 PM - 6 AM\"), temperatures, dollar amounts\n",
    "3. **Show calculations**: \"Based on $0.15/kWh peak rate, you'll save $X\"\n",
    "4. **Reference data**: \"According to your usage history...\" / \"The forecast shows...\"\n",
    "5. **Quantify savings**: Always use calculate_energy_savings when discussing money\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Mistakes to AVOID:\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Giving thermostat advice without checking weather forecast\n",
    "❌ Discussing savings without calling calculate_energy_savings  \n",
    "❌ Answering \"when to run appliance\" questions without checking electricity prices\n",
    "❌ Solar advice without querying both history AND forecast\n",
    "❌ Personalized advice without checking query_energy_usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: Every recommendation must be backed by data from tools. Generic advice = FAILURE.\n",

      "2. **Maximize Solar Power**: \n",
      "   - If you prefer to charge during the day, aim for **10 AM - 12 PM** when solar irradiance is at its peak (around 870 W/m²). However, be aware that electricity rates will be higher during this time ($0.1569 - $0.1722).\n",
      "\n",

       "    AIMessage(content=\"To determine the most cost-effective charging schedule for your EV this week in San Francisco, I gathered data on electricity prices, solar generation forecasts, and weather conditions. Here's what I found:\\n\\n### Electricity Prices (October 2, 2023)\\n- **Off-Peak Rates** (Lowest):\\n  - 12 AM - 5 AM: $0.0916 to $0.0958\\n  - 10 PM - 11 PM: $0.0797 to $0.0883\\n- **Peak Rates** (Highest):\\n  - 6 AM - 9 AM: $0.153 to $0.1786\\n  - 4 PM - 7 PM: $0.1591 to $0.1743\\n\\n### Weather Forecast and Solar Generation\\n- **Solar Generation**: There is no solar generation data available for this week, indicating that solar power may not be a viable option for charging your EV during the day.\\n- **Weather Conditions**: The forecast shows a mix of sunny and cloudy days, but without solar generation data, we cannot rely on solar energy for charging.\\n\\n### Recommendations for Charging Schedule\\nGiven the electricity pricing and lack of solar generation data, the most cost-effective charging times for your EV this week would be during the **off-peak hours**:\\n\\n1. **Charge Overnight**:\\n   - **12 AM - 5 AM**: Rates are between $0.0916 and $0.0958.\\n   - **10 PM - 11 PM**: Rates drop to $0.0797 to $0.0883.\\n\\n### Actionable Steps\\n- **Set your EV to charge** during the off-peak hours, ideally starting at **10 PM** and finishing by **5 AM** to take advantage of the lowest rates.\\n- If you need to charge during the day, avoid the peak hours (6 AM - 9 AM and 4 PM - 7 PM) to minimize costs.\\n\\n### Additional Tips\\n- Consider using a smart charger that can be programmed to charge during these off-peak hours automatically.\\n- Monitor your EV's battery level to ensure you have enough charge for your daily needs while taking advantage of the lower rates.\\n\\nBy following this schedule, you can optimize your EV charging costs effectively!

       "    AIMessage(content=\"It appears that there is no recorded energy usage for your HVAC system in October 2023, which makes it difficult to provide specific savings calculations based on your current usage. However, I can still provide insights based on the electricity pricing and weather forecast.\\n\\n### Electricity Pricing\\nHere are the peak and off-peak rates for today:\\n- **Peak Hours (6 AM - 8 PM)**: Rates range from $0.1485 to $0.1768 per kWh.\\n- **Off-Peak Hours (8 PM - 6 AM)**: Rates range from $0.0723 to $0.0858 per kWh.\\n\\n### Weather Forecast\\nToday's forecast indicates a high temperature of around 19°C (66°F) with partly cloudy conditions. This suggests that you may not need to run your HVAC system excessively, especially during the cooler hours.\\n\\n### Recommendations\\n1. **Adjust HVAC Settings**: \\n   - **Set your thermostat to a higher temperature during peak hours** (6 AM - 8 PM) to reduce cooling needs. For example, if you usually set it to 22°C (72°F), consider raising it to 24°C (75°F).\\n   - **Utilize off-peak hours** (after 8 PM) for any cooling needs, as the rates are significantly lower.\\n\\n2. **Potential Savings Calculation**:\\n   - If you can reduce your HVAC usage during peak hours by 1 kWh, you could save approximately:\\n     - **Peak Rate**: $0.1768 (if you run it during peak)\\n     - **Off-Peak Rate**: $0.0858 (if you run it during off-peak)\\n     - **Savings per kWh**: $0.1768 - $0.0858 = **$0.091 per kWh saved**.\\n\\n3. **Action Steps**:\\n   - Monitor your HVAC usage and try to limit it during peak hours.\\n   - Consider using fans or natural ventilation during the day to keep your home comfortable without relying heavily on HVAC.\\n\\n### Additional Tips\\nI recommend checking for energy-saving tips specific to HVAC systems.

       "    AIMessage(content=\"Here are some practical tips to reduce your home energy consumption:\\n\\n1. **Turn Off Lights and Unplug Devices**: Always turn off lights when not in use and unplug devices that draw standby power. This can significantly reduce your energy usage.\\n\\n2. **Use Natural Lighting**: Take advantage of natural light during the day instead of relying on artificial lighting. \\n\\n3. **Switch to Energy-Efficient Bulbs**: Replace incandescent bulbs with energy-efficient LEDs, which use less energy and last longer.\\n\\n4. **Maintain Appliances**: Keep your appliances clean and well-maintained to ensure they operate efficiently. \\n\\n5. **Smart Thermostats**: Consider installing a smart thermostat, which can save up to 10% on heating and cooling costs by automatically adjusting temperatures when you're away. Set your thermostat to 68°F in winter and 78°F in summer for optimal savings.\\n\\n6. **Wash Clothes Efficiently**: Wash clothes in cold water and only run full loads. Use the dryer's moisture sensor instead of timed drying, and clean the lint filter after every load to improve efficiency.\\n\\n7. **Seal Air Leaks**: Seal air leaks around windows and doors with weatherstripping or caulk. Adding insulation to attics and walls can also reduce heating and cooling needs.\\n\\n8. **Use Power Strips**: Use power strips to easily turn off multiple devices at once, as many electronics continue to draw power even when turned off (phantom load).\\n\\n9. **Consider Energy-Efficient Appliances**: When replacing old appliances, look for ENERGY STAR certified products that use 10-50% less energy than standard models.\\n\\n10. **Shade Your Home**: Plant trees or install awnings to provide shade during summer months, which can reduce cooling costs by up to 25%.\\n\\n11. **Use Ceiling Fans**: Ceiling fans can help circulate air and make rooms feel cooler, allowing you to raise the thermostat temperature by 4°F without discomfort.\\n\\nImplementing these tips can lead to significant energy savings and a reduced environmental impact.\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 413, 'prompt_tokens': 2601, 'total_tokens': 3014, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 1536}}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_560af6e559', 'id': 'chatcmpl-CZ0qxjTFSNfCF5KnamMSsLjDIlS5a', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='energy_advisor', id='lc_run--3204d6df-7e95-4eb2-87a1-64dbe5fd2be3-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2601, 'output_tokens': 413, 'total_tokens': 3014, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 1536}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]},\n",
